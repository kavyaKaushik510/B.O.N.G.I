2025 EEE4113F Design Project UCT - Conservation of African Penguins
Biological Obeservation and Navigation for Guano Investigation
This repository contains the design, development, and documentation for a remotely operated system created to assist in the conservation of African Penguins during their vulnerable moulting period. Developed as part of the 2025 EEE4113F Design Project at the University of Cape Town, the system enables non-invasive health monitoring by collecting faecal samples for stress analysis. The project follows a human-centred design approach and integrates mechanical, electrical, and software subsystems.
